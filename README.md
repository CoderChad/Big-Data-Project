# Big Data Project
Intro: This is an individual project I completed for a Data Science class. We were tasked with extrapoloting insights and attributes through our analysis of New York City Middle School data provided by the New York City Department of Education. 

We were interested in determing whether certain characteristics of a middle school (e.g. class size, per student spending) could predict a student's likelihood of admission into one of eight highly selective New York City High Schools. 



Questions and Results:

1) What is the correlation between the number of applications and admissions to HSPHS?

3) What is a better predictor of admission to HSPHS? Raw number of applications or
application *rate*?
3) Which school has the best *per student* odds of sending someone to HSPHS?
4) Is there a relationship between how students perceive their school (as reported in columns
L-Q) and how the school performs on objective measures of achievement (as noted in
columns V-X).
5) Test a hypothesis of your choice as to which kind of school (e.g. small schools vs. large
schools or charter schools vs. not (or any other classification, such as rich vs. poor school))
performs differently than another kind either on some dependent measure, e.g. objective
measures of achievement or admission to HSPHS (pick one).
6) Is there any evidence that the availability of material resources (e.g. per student spending
or class size) impacts objective measures of achievement or admission to HSPHS?
7) What proportion of schools accounts for 90% of all students accepted to HSPHS?
8) Build a model of your choice – clustering, classification or prediction – that includes all
factors – as to what school characteristics are most important in terms of a) sending
students to HSPHS, b) achieving high scores on objective measures of achievement?
9) Write an overall summary of your findings – what school characteristics seem to be most
relevant in determining acceptance of their students to HSPHS?
10) Imagine that you are working for the New York City Department of Education as a data
scientist (like one of my former students). What actionable recommendations would you
make on how to improve schools so that they a) send more students to HSPHS and b)
improve objective measures or achievement.
